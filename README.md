This code produces a figure comparing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (in parts per million) to Global Air Temperature Anomaly.
The data is from the years 1850-2023, and is gathered from the following sources:

CO<sub>2</sub> concentration data:

1850-1957: D.M. Etheridge, L.P. Steele, R.L. Langenfelds, R.J. Francey, "Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over the last 1000 years from air in Antarctic ice and firn"; https://doi.org/10.1029/95JD03410
