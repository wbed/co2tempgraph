This code produces a figure comparing CO2 concentration (in parts per million) to Global Air Temperature Anomaly.
The data is from the years 1850-2023, and is gathered from the following sources:

CO2 ppm data:

1850-1957: D.M. Etheridge, L.P. Steele, R.L. Langenfelds, R.J. Francey, "Natural and anthroupogenic changes in atmospheric CO2 over the last 1000 years from air in Antarctic ice and firn".

1958-1974: Means of Scripps Institution of Oceanography Continuous Data at Mauna Loa and South Pole provided by KenMaarie; https://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelforce/ghgases/Fig1A.ext.txt

1975-2023: Lan, X., Tans, P. and K.W. Thoning: Trends in globally averaged CO2 determined from NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements. Version 2024-11; https://doi.org/10.15138/9N0H-ZH07
